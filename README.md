# RNA-Seq
This is a repository for the RNA Seq project for the Genomics and Bioinformatics course. It describes the steps taken to analyze RNASeq data under two experimental conditions and determine differntial gene expression. 
## Scripts
The scripts folder  includes Slurm scripts used to each step of the analysis.
## Results
Results files include a table of the change of expression of all genes, a summary table for the differentially expressed genes, a volcano plot visualizing differntial expression, and the results of a gene ontology enrichment test.
